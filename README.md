# Mobile Ising
Ising model with movable sites in a 2D lattice

We construct a extended Ising model to simulate the magnetization of a 2D lattice under different temperatures. In addition to flipping the spin of a site, we allow two directly neighboring elements to swap their locations while preserving their spins. This swapping is equivalent to flipping two neighboring sites at the same time and exchanging their identity used in the simulation.
